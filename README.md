# Music Player using Java AWT

This project is a simple **Music Player** application developed using **Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**. The application allows users to play, pause, stop, and control the volume of audio files. It demonstrates the basic concepts of building a GUI (Graphical User Interface) in Java and interacting with audio files.

## Features

- **Play**: Play audio files in various formats.
- **Pause**: Pause the current audio playback.
- **Stop**: Stop the playback and reset the audio.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume of the audio.
- **Playlist**: Select audio files from a playlist and play them sequentially.
- **Basic GUI**: Built using Java AWT for a simple and easy-to-use interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Java AWT**: For creating the user interface.
- **Java Sound API**: For playing audio files.
- **Java Swing**: (Optional, if needed for additional features like file dialog or additional components).
